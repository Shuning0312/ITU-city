# WaterGuard: Trustworthy Digital Infrastructure for Global Water Governance 🌍💧

**WaterGuard** is a forward-looking research and demonstration project that integrates **blockchain**, **digital twin**, and **AI** technologies to build a trustworthy, transparent, and intelligent system for urban water governance. It was developed for the [1st UN Citiverse Challenge](https://www.itu.int/metaverse/virtual-worlds/1st-un-citiverse-challenge/), focusing on sustainable, secure, and inclusive smart city infrastructure.

## 🔧 Features

- **Three-Stage Progressive Framework**:
  - Trusted Data Space (blockchain-based integrity and privacy)
  - Drainage Metaverse (digital twin modeling & simulation)
  - Open Digital Infrastructure (interoperable water governance services)

- **Interactive Demonstrations**:
  - Water quality monitoring and AI-based forecasting
  - Emergency response plan generation
  - Blockchain ledger viewing and verification

- **Technical Innovations**:
  - Privacy-preserving data exchange
  - Real-time IoT data integration
  - Predictive maintenance algorithms
